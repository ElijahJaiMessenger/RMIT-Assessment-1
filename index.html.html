  <p><strong>&nbsp;My profile</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone My name is Elijah but most call me EJ. I&rsquo;m 21 years old and i&rsquo;m almost always love meeting new people! I almost always wanna make people laugh cause I love putting a smile on people's faces. I enjoy playing footy, I've been playing AFL football since I could stand on two feet and enjoy playing at a high standard. I also DJ as a hobby playing funky techno with a hint of spice. You can always find me either playing or cuddling my dog 247. Mollie is a kelpie x german shepherd, even though she's big and scary. She's soft inside and just a big carebear.</p>
<p><strong>What is your interest in IT?</strong></p>
<p>I am interested in IT, to help and put a smile on people&rsquo;s faces when I solve an issue that they couldn&rsquo;t solve themselves. I love when I solve a problem and they're jumping with joy and can&rsquo;t stop smiling. I want to do that on a larger scale. My parents sparked my interest into IT with my mum buying her first computer and I would sit on her lap as a toddler watching her just use it. My dad inspired me to further my inspiration in IT when he helped me build my first computer at the age of 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How much experience do i have in IT?</strong></p>
<p>I have little experience in IT as during my high school year I was aspiring to become a AFL footballer.or primary school teacher. I have a strong knowledge about it but have little to non experience of the fundamentals on how to use them.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a first year Uni student who took 2 years off before starting. It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do, I looked at what subjects I did well in during high school and that I enjoyed, looked to see what courses were offered from there, found a few I thought I'd enjoy, theni went online and did some googling and now narrowed it down what I wanted to do. And now i'm currently studying a bachelor of Information technology.</p>
<p><strong>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The results of an online learning style test:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&amp;A=6&amp;V=7&amp;T=7">http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&amp;A=6&amp;V=7&amp;T=7</a></p>
<p><strong>The results of Big Five Personality test:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/21748321">https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/21748321</a></p>
<p><strong>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</strong></p>
<p>They can be fun, but i feel like they shouldn't be taken too seriously since there are too many variables in personality to sort them so rigidly. For example, the Meyers Briggs test is pretty neat, I actually feel like taking it helped me understand myself a little bit better. My result stated things that are true about me in a way I hadn't thought about before. But it just seems unrealistic to me to say there are only 16 types of people.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;I work very well as a team member. I would never take it upon myself to make any decision on my own. The very thought is laughable. I will always support any decision the team makes, no matter how stupid it is.</p>
<p><strong>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</strong></p>
<p>I like to assist and cooperate with my teammates more evidently and draw my coworkers into teams where everyone can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and suggestions, working together to develop win-win situations that get the job done. My tolerance, open-mindedness and easy sociability make it easy for my teammates to relate.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Technologies </strong>- we&rsquo;d use <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that and use program languages like Python. And use <strong>Python</strong> to develop web applications. software applications, pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems.We&rsquo;d also use Appery.io to develop the app for smartphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skills Required </strong>- The skills required to develop this product and the tasks that needed to be completed is. Someone who is knowledgeable in using python to develop the code for the collar someone whos continent in app making design to design the app for IOS, android etc, Someone who can design me construct a collar that is well design using Raspberry Pi Technology and someone who to sell and gain investors to fund the project.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome </strong>- The outcome of this project would be to have a fully developed website that would show all the current and developing features, and a prototype of the collar to show the design and the different variety you can buy, tested features for example a rough draft on how it monitors your dogs activities, and how it can be uploaded to a cloud server where the dated can be stored and accessed from a tap or click of a button.&nbsp;</p>
